Virtualization: logical division of physical computing resources
vm - software based instance of a physical server where a guest operating system has access to emulated physical hardware.

container - os level vitualization. os kernel provides isolated user spaces to run specific applications.
 - the os is sliced up into isolated secure area to run application
 - containers can be run in virtual machines
 - have less overhead and faster startup time than vms
 
Private hybrid and pblic cloud - types of IAAS offerings
private - on premises 
public - cloud
hybrid - private cloud and public cloud are working together same with enterprise cloud

virtuaization vs private cloud

pricing models
ondemand - pay for what you use on the hour
spot-instances - bid on spare computing capacity for upto 90% off the price
reserved instances - 
dedicated host - 

service level agreement SLA
- defines what level of performance and availability the IAAS provider will provide you
- and what they will do if they are unable to provide yo that level of service.

Migrating to the cloud

green field deployment - start afresh in the clous

migration - 
things to consider
------------------
before migrating calculate the cost
what is required in termsm of security availablty and performance
enterprise grade functionality
do you want to migrate or rebuild
tools to make your migration easier
