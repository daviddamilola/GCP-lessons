IAAS security

cloud security concerns
 - is the data safe
 - who can see the data
 - can it be modified
 - who is responsible for securing the data
 
unless you have managed security, the security of your data in the cloud is under shared responsibility
meaning that the resposibilty of securing the data is shared between u and your cloud provider

 eg laws - depending on the kind of business data you are working with
 requirements
 policies
 standards 
 rules etc
